Client/Server Development

<ins> How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? </ins> <br><br><be>
Detailed and efficient comments make your code maintainable. Proper use of whitespace as well as descriptive names for methods, variables, etc... make your code readable. You can make your code adaptable by writing them to be modular and utilizing abstraction. Modular code breaks things down into smaller, more independent modules. This allows you to adapt your code to different purposes without affecting the whole. This abstracts away unnecessary details and allows those details to be dictated later. A good example of this is the CRUD Python module I made in this course. I can use this to create, read, update, or delete documents in other MongoDB databases in the future. 

<ins> How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? </ins> <br><br><be>
You can approach any problem by following 6 steps:
- Identify the problem
- Break down the problem
- Identify a solution
- Implement a solution
- Test, test, and test some more
- Learn from the solution <br><br>
You can apply this to any problem be it bugs, client requirements, platform limitations, or anything else you can think of. I plan on using this to efficiently and effectively tackle the many problems development throughs at you. My approach to this project differs as my problems become more complex as I move through my degree. They need to be broken down and taken on step by step. 

<ins> What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? </ins> <br><br><be>
Computer scientists solve problems and make people's lives/jobs better. Computers are made to do jobs that people don't want to or can't do themselves. They work for and serve the user. They fulfill needs and solve problems. This matters because it allows us, as a species, to push the boundaries of our capabilities and make life better for everyone. In this particular circumstance, Grazioso Salvare could never have organized and utilized all the data they would have gotten from animal shelters. With our help, they can utilize that data and find, train, and deploy more rescue service animals at a drastically more effective rate than before.
